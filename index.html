    <p>Im just making a project for fun I do not yet know what it wil be about so I will just write down as much as I can on thi website about the first thing that comes to my head.</p>
     
<p>Ive decided ill write something about my mom.

</p>
<h1>My Mom</h1>
<p>I love my mom alot but sometimes she does things unbearable that dosen't make any sense.
  Sometimes she'll tell me to do fifty things at once but gets furious when i forget one thing,
  maybe im tired after school or just got back from kirate but she still gets mad that I don't vacum the living room
  sometmes I can't even tell if anythings even dirty. She only does nice things to instantly benifit she takes you to get you're hair done welp you should'nt do anything else after that seems enjoyable
  she'll expect you to spend money on her without thinking since she did something for you you automaticly owe her everything since she did this or she gave birth to you and you owe her respect reguardlessly and
  its frusterating that some parents do this but honestly its just better for you to do better know-matter how frusterating it is listaning to their random absurd resons that make absolutiy no fricking sense its better to show them love either way.
